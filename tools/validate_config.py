"""Validate config.json against the live repos it points at.

HuB's whole job is fetching status_log.jsonl from the URLs in config.json. A
typo in an owner, repo, or branch field silently degrades the dashboard to an
amber "no data" tab, and nothing currently fails. This script is that check.

Run: python3 tools/validate_config.py             # validate the real config
     python3 tools/validate_config.py --self-test # prove the check can fail
Exit 0 = every tracked repo resolves; 1 = at least one does not.

Why this resolves the branch rather than fetching the raw URL
------------------------------------------------------------
Fetching raw.githubusercontent.com/{owner}/{repo}/{branch}/status_log.jsonl
cannot detect a dead branch, and the earlier version of this script therefore
passed against branches that did not exist. Two separate causes, both verified
against this portfolio on 2026-09-22:

1. GitHub serves a deleted-or-never-existing branch lazily, from whatever
   content it last had. `ephapse` has no `dev` branch - the API agrees - yet
   raw.githubusercontent.com/philipdallen/ephapse/dev/status_log.jsonl returns
   200 with a byte-identical copy of main's log (md5 a7ae3448...). No redirect,
   no error. A stale branch name looks perfectly healthy.
2. /branches/{branch} itself cannot be used to check existence, because GitHub
   redirects it to the default branch: GET /branches/dev on `ephapse` returns
   301 -> /branches/main, so a naive `status == 200` after following redirects
   resolves a *nonexistent* branch to a *real* one and reports success. This is
   the same defect class the script exists to catch, so it is worth being
   explicit: the fix is NOT to stop following redirects.

The reliable check is GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/heads/{branch} - 404
when the branch is absent, 200 when present, no redirect. On success we then
fetch the log pinned to the resolved commit SHA, so the content check also
cannot be satisfied by a stale ref.
